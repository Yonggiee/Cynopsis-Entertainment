Docker

Why Docker

- Frameworks / libraries require different dependencies like OS/python version etc
- Dependency versions constantly changing
- Hard to set up new environment for new developers
- Rune each component in a separate container with different dependencies
- Docker use LXc containers
- Docker makes use of the underlying OS kernel so the OS kernel must be the same like Linux/Mac/Windows
