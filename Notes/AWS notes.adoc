Cloudfront
Edge Location - This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ
Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will be distributed. This can be S3 bucket, EC2 instance, ELB or Route53
Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations
Web Distribution - typically used for Websites
RTMP - Used for Media Streaming
Edge locations are not just READ only - you can write to them too (put an object

AWS Region/AZ means the available zones (AZ) of a AWS region are at

IAM is universal, it does not apply to regions at this time.
The 'root account' is simply the account created when first setting up your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.
New Users have NO permissions when first created.
New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created. (console access or programmatic access).
These are not the same as a password. You cannot use the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to login to the console. You can use this to access AWS via 

AWS EC2
- EC2 is a web-service which aims to make life easier for developers by providing secure and resizeble compute capacity in the cloud.
- Steps to use EC2
. Create an AMI(Amazon Machine Image)
. Choose an instance type (type/size of hardware)
. Configure the instance
. Adding storage
. Add tags to easily identify an Ec2 instance
. Configure firewall/security group to accept or block external connection to the instance based on port number and ip address
. Review the configuration to deploy

AMI
- is a template that is used to create a new instance/machine based on user requirement
- software/additional applications/OS/access permissions
- Two types of AMI
. predefined AMIs / Custom AMIs that we create
- Five families
. Compute optimized (high computing)
. Memory optimized (caching)
. GPU optimized (gaming/large graphical requirements)
. Storage optimized (storage servers)
. General purpose (well-balanced)
- Configure the instance
. Assign public address to it
. Assign authentication
. Shutdown behaviour(stop(shutdown the system)/terminate(give control back to Amazon))
. Bootstraps the instance with some scripts
. Choose the payment type
- Add storage
. Ephemeral (temperory and free)/ Amazon Elastic Block Store (permanent and paid) / Amazon S3
. Whether it needs to be encrypted
- Review
. Private(user) and public(amazon) key

S3
- storage
- Elastic Block Store is like a SSD hardware attached to the EC2 instance
- Elastic File System is like EBS but EFS is shared systems so can be accessed by multiple instances compared to EBS
- Glacier is to archive
- Storage gateway have local storage and cloud/internet users access the local storage
- S3 is object storage service, cannot install anything in it.
- One of the cheapest(low cost)
- Secure (encryption, MFA authentication)
- Features Bucket policies, life cycle policies, versioning control

Object
- consists of data, key and metadata

Bucket
- Stores objects
- when data added to bucket creates a unique version ID and allocates to the object
- Have unique names

Storage clases
. standard (less or low latency)
. Infrequent data access
. Glacier (archiving)
. One Zone (infrequent and in one location only)
. Standard reduced redundancy storage (non critical and can be replaced if lost)

Lifecycle Management
- Move the object or bucket to another tier after some time
- Transition actions and expiration actions

Bucket policies
- Any and deny permission to the s3 resource
- Use json file to define the policy

Data encryption
- Client-side encryption at rest
- Server-side encryption in motion

Versioning
- Something like git commits

Cross-Region Replication
- automatic copying of every object uploaded to your buckets in different AWS regions
- Versioning must be enabled

Transfer acceleration
- Fast, easy and secure transfer of files over long distance
- Content delivery network that securely transfers data to your destination with high transfer speed
